## Things to work on (TLDR;)

## Notes
### First Half (Defending)
#### Round 1
- Clear and concise with team
- **WWIDD:** Not enter the smoke with a knife, and aim a little higher on the reyna in cubby
#### Round 2
- Practice crosshair placement on long angles like peaking A long at start of round
- Good Job playing around utility
- **WWIDD:** Not reload as often
#### Round 3
- Good Support smokes, but I should look at reacting with my smokes quicker
- Good Use communicating holding angle/trade while spike was dropped
#### Round 4
- Good counter smoke
- aim a little higher
- Good use trying to shoot through radiant box
- Work on placing smokes ontop of sage walls
- **WWIDD:** Not tp ontop of sage wall since I didn't land the smoke right/Place smoke on box instead of wall
#### Round 5
