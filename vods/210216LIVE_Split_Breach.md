- Final Score - 13-5 (18 Rounds)

## Things to work on (TLDR;)
- Don't entry as a support character. That's what duelists are for
- Don't wide swing on flashes if more than 1-2 agents flashed
- Slow down and focus on aim

## Notes
#### First Half (Defending)
Round 1  
- Take shots slower and work on raising crosshair to headlevel
- **What I could do Different:** Keep my crosshair placed at the edge of boxes for when Brim ultimately popped out  
Round 2  
- Take more time and focus on aim
- **WICDD:** after missing a few shots, back up and recompose before reentering combat
Round3  
- Don't wide swing on a flash when I know there's more than 1 person I've flashed
- Work on Flash Timings; I keep pulling them too close to an enemy peak
- **WICDD:** Shallow/med peak off flash + Crosshair placement  
Round 4  
- Work on flash timings to give me time to counter
- **WICDD:** Flash once, backup, flash twice then fight  
Round 5  
- Good Job keeping crosshair on market while rotating B heaven to ropes
- **WICDD:** Assumed Jett was in AMain Cubby. Call it out  
Round 6  
- Play more defensively on Skye's ultimate
- Good Callouts  
Round 7  
- Didn't clear mailroom
- **WICDD:** Could of used aftershock to clear mailroom because I knew reyna was closed, would've of forced her in a bad position, and could probably atleast self trade  
Round 8  
- Good use of swapping spots to adapt better (Wasn't playing well heaven
- Aim where they could be at while moving  
Round 9  
- acknowledge whats wrong with my playstyle in-game and what I can do to adjust it
- Good use setting up my team
- Using ult to allow the final kill
- Goodgamesense to use aftershock to deny the placement
- **WICDD:** use one of my flashes on back corner or piller to full blind enemies  
Round 10  
- Steven doesn't watch my streams :(
- Good combo with faultline/aftershock to kill A main cubby.
- Good use of flashes to prevent A push
- **WICDD:** Not much I would do differently. I have a pretty solid play for holding A site  
Round 11
- Don't wide peak on a push
- **WICDD:** slightly change the angle I use my flash on Asite to deny the push from multiple angles (Aim higher maybe?)  
Round 12
- Needlessly aggressive peak off A Elbow
- Nice attempt to use aftershock to delay A heaven push, but should working on placement/timings
- Don't solo push, wait for team rotate, and retake together  
#### Second Half (Attacking)  
Round 13
- Don't entry as breach
- **WICDD:** Try to bait utility to figure out their playstyle  
Round 14
- Good Teamwork/communication
- Work on calling where flashes are going and when
- **WWIDD:** Don't play so aggressive when we have the upper hand  
Round 15
- Don't push while reloading incase they repeak 
- don't entry with your util out
Round 16
- When pushing stick to the edges so i have some form of cover
- **WWIDD** Flash > Check Ropes while crossing over to Sewers > Check Heaven then push up  
Round 17
- Good use of adapting to what the enemy does
- set myself up to trade
- Call earlier rotates if they're using utility
- **WWIDD:** I knew the reyna would be sewers I should of flashed T walkway and peaked instead of trying to flash A Sewers enterance  
Round 18
- Good crossfire setup with sage while blinded
- Good Rotate calling
- Don't push too far ahead of my team when rotating incase we need to trade
- Good use pushing off OP.
- **WWIDD:** I knew Brim was alive and only used 1 smoke so far, Probably should've stuck with the phantom since He'd most likely smoke off any op-ing lanes  
End-of-Game  
Final Score: 13-5
