- Final Score - 13-3 (16 Rounds)

## Things to work on (TLDR;)
- Crosshair placement while waiting for push (Aim for sneak around corner instead of looking at wall ready to swing)
- (OMEN) shadowstep to reposition before repeaking

## Notes
### First Half (Defending)
#### Round 1
- Fix crosshair placement. No one's going to be popping out of a wall
#### Round 2
- Good Teamwork, playing together,
- **WWIDD:** Count down for the dual peek slower so I don't rush my teammate
#### Round 3
- Good job on quick rotate
- **WWIDD:** Rotate back up elbow after seeing site clear and blocked off by sage wall
#### Round 4
- **WWIDD:** Don't expose myself to two angles
#### Round 5
- Good Position
- Should've communicated with my sage what they were doing prior to smoking mid
- **WWIDD:** Smoke off the wall to isolate the reyna and ropes then set up a 1v1 instead of killing reyna then getting traded
#### Round 6
-  Good use of playing early intel
-  If enemy Omen ults, keep gun out and ready for them
-  **WWIDD:** Hard clear CT and Screens corner
#### Round 7
- Good use of isolating gun fights then backing up to rengage
- Fix Crosshair placement
- Good use of hard clearing boxes
- **WWIDD:** Not reload while backing up incase they swung
#### Round 8
- Should've called out the reyna when she swung
- **WWIDD** I'm not sure, I had solid position for raze and I to both trade eachother
#### Round 9
- Nice entry peak
- **WWIDD:** Should not repeak on the initial push especially after getting first pick. Instead should've shadowstepped to other side of ramp and peaked that
#### Round 11
- Good call on the early rotate based on early info
- **WWIDD:** Shadow Step to shed to repeak cypher in Garage
#### Round 12
- Good Job planning the peak
- **WWIDD:** Not be so close to raze who uses blast pack
### Second Half (Attacking)
#### Round 13
- **WWIDD** Crosshair placement for sage peak since it's common for sages to peak on top of their walls when placed mid
#### Round 14
- Tried to refrag my teammate, didn't work out. Probs should work on my classic, crosshair placement, and tracking
#### Round 15
- Good positioning for the refrag when pushing heaven with raze
- Good reposition and crosshair placement
- **WWIDD** instead of waiting to swing on the trade, be posted to prevent the raze death to begin with
#### Round 16
- Didn't check corner, but at the same time, they never played up close in A-Main.

### End-of-Game
Final Score: 13-3
