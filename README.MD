# VOD Review Notes
One of the main aspects to improve in any game/sport is to be able to go back and analyze what went right and wrong so you can improve and grow.  

### How I do my vod reviews
For gaming, one of the best ways to do that is to record your gameplay then watch it back so you can analyze your gameplay from fresh perspective. Personally, I like to write down my analysis while vod reviewing since it helps me better commit it to memory. To do this, I use NeoVim and Markdown to have a nice easy format to write/readback later.  
### Format
To use, I copy the notesTemplate.md under the name I use for the specific match I'm vod review, and then I follow the template to record my analysis. Outside of that, it's just filling in my observations as I watch my vod.
