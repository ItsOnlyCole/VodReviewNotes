- Final Score - 10-13 (23 Rounds)

## Things to work on (TLDR;)
- Work on getting a default flash route for A-site
- Work on finding good ult positions on both attack and defense 
- Getting the pick then falling back to resetup instead of overextending for next pick 
- Call all my util


## Notes
### First Half (Attacking)
#### Round 1
- Good Flash setup for Jett to dash into site
- Good tracking
- **WWIDD:** Play a different position to stall time a little more
#### Round 2
- Learn a flash route for A-site
- **WWIDD:** Play closer to the Stinger's strength
#### Round 3
- Good use to countering Reyna but wasn't really an impact kill
#### Round 4
- Find better ult placement for push
- **WWIDD:** Watch tree instead of heaven from my position then reposition when I have a chance
#### Round 5
- Play with spike
- Good flash to get onto B-site
- **WWIDD:** Should've been more decisive in my action after Sova's drone saw me
#### Round 6
- Good communication to figure out where we can improve. Sadly no one responded
- Should keep my crosshair on where they might be while rotating
- **WWIDD:** I knew where sage was at, should've picked an angle and held it 
#### Round 7
- Good job covering my teammate while they're in astral mode
- Good use of flash and faultline to clear angles
#### Round 8
- Need to call out my utility usage
- Work on my long distance fighting skills
#### Round 9
- Unlucky. Had good crosshair placement for if sage pulled back and peaked mid but got caught off guard by sova
#### Round 10
- Good use clearing an angle Omen might have pushed with his paranoia
- Good rotate call
- **WWIDD:** Work on my gamesense. I miscalculated where one player might be which led to me wide swinging into both players
#### Round 11
- Great Gamesense to counter Sova with my aftershock
#### Round 12
- Good use of fautline to clear tree for my cat player
- Good use of determining the enemy's location then playing the angle instead of being overly agressive
- **WWIDD:** Use my ult to help with initial push
###Second Half (Defending)
#### Round 13
- **WWIDD:** I wasn't position well to use my utility since Jett was in front of me. Either communicate my plans with Jett or reposition.
#### Round 14
- Got killed because the Cypher swung ledge.
- **WWIDD:** Prefire the corner then use util before pushing
#### Round 15
- **WWIDD:** Pull back to site instead of cubby since I got trapped
#### Round 16
- Good use of flash to stall the push.
- **WWIDD:** Not get so greedy and repeak/push for the second frag. Instead back towards site and setup for another easy pick on the enemy push.
#### Round 17
- **WWIDD:** take a more defensive position to prevent the enemy from dropping out of ledge.
#### Round 18
- Good Rotate call
- Good crosshair placement for what I thought the sage did (Drop down from ledge) overall though bad gamesense
#### Round 19
- Good positioning to stall push.
- **WWIDD:** After the second pick back up to boxes or boathouse
#### Round 20
- Good ult to completely shut down the enemy push
- AN ABSOLUTE BALLER A1 Play
#### Round 21 
- **WWIDD:** once my team started pushing B-Main, I should've roated to a better position to support
#### Round 22 
- Good quick rotate
- Good util usage to clear hell
- Good use calling for defuse while I cover the angle where we know the last enemy player is at 
#### Round 23
- Should'nt have grabbed ult orb
- **WWIDD:** taken note that if my B-site teammate died they could've wrapped me on stairs

### End-of-Game
Final Score: 10-13
