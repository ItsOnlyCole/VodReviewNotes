- Final Score - x-x (y Rounds)

## Things to work on (TLDR;)

## Notes
### First Half (Attacking)
#### Round 01
- Didn't really take any engagements
- Left myself exposed once I did take engagements
- **What would I do differently:** I would choose to push in and take closer engagements on pistol round
#### Round 02
- Good use of smoke to adapt to KJ turrent
- Good Callout for rotate
- **WWIDD:** Maybe try to play for a clear site before planting
#### Round 03
- Good callout that we're double faking
- Good use of shadowstep into the smoke to push forward
- Good Communication to make sure all angles were watched post plant
- **WWIDD**: Not much. It was a good play
#### Round 04

### End-of-Game
Final Score:
