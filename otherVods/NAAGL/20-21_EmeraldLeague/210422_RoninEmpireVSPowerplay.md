- Match Score 2-0 (Ronin-PP)

## Key Takeaways
### Ronin Empire
#### How to Counter on Attack
- Take ult orbs with ease
- Use sage walls + slow orbs for stalling retake
- Use pushes, fakes, and double fakes to trick them out of quick rotates
- Expect heavy aggression or when we're eco-ing or down on rounds toward the end of a half
#### How to Counter on Defense
- Expect heavy aggression when we're down on rounds/on eco
- Expect them to alternate sites every round (Except Ascent. They favored Bsite/Mid)
- They rarely faked
- They split push a lot
- Generally will take sites that play to their equipment's strengths
- (On Icebox) Omen smoke mid indicates a mid push
- Tend to fumble into each other if running from an ult (Sova's ult is what they ran from in the VOD)
